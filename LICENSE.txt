DRAFT 9/29/14GUMGUMiOS Software Development Kit License AgreementThe GumGum iOS Software Development Kit (referred to as the “SDK”) is licensed to you subject to the terms and conditions in this License Agreement (“License Agreement”).  This License Agreement is a legally binding contract between you and GumGum, Inc., a Delaware corporation having a principal place of business at 225 Santa Monica Blvd., 6th Floor, Santa Monica, CA 90401 (“GumGum”).  You must agree to this License Agreement before you may use the SDK.  If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, you may not use the SDK and you must discontinue all use of the SDK immediately.1.	Acceptance.  BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT OR AGREE TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO ALL OF ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  Also, by clicking to accept or agree to this License Agreement, you are waiving, to the extent permitted under applicable law, any rights or legal requirements that require an original (non-electronic) signature or the delivery or retention of non-electronic records in order for a contract to be legally binding.  If you use the SDK, you will be deemed to have accepted this License Agreement even if you did not click to accept it.  If you are using the SDK on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such other entity to this License Agreement.  If you do not have such authority, then you may not use the SDK on behalf of your employer and you must discontinue all use of the SDK immediately.2.	Description of Software.  The SDK allows GumGum to serve advertisements within software applications you developed using the SDK.  The SDK is implemented as a software library to be included in your development environment and used for the development of software applications to be executed on the Apple iOS mobile devices of end users (“Derived Works”) solely as described herein.  Any Derived Works to be sold, distributed or otherwise provided to end users must first be compiled to a single executable binary file according to specific requirements set forth in Section 4.1 below (such Derived Work that has been compiled for sale, distribution or other provision to end users, a “Licensee Application”).  GumGum provides, along with the SDK, documentation and a description of the interfaces (“Documentation”).3.	License Terms and Conditions.3.1.	License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, GumGum grants you a limited, personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-assignable license to download, install, execute and use the SDK (i) to include the SDK into your development environment for the development of Derived Works, (ii) to statically link the SDK to Derived Works, producing a Licensee Application in the form of a single compiled binary file and (iii) to redistribute the SDK in binary form as part of a Licensee Application to be sold, distributed or otherwise provided, directly or indirectly, to end users, solely as described herein and pursuant to the specific requirements set forth in Section 4.1.  GumGum reserves all right, title and interest in and to the SDK not expressly granted to you under this License Agreement.3.2.	Ownership.  The SDK is licensed to you and not sold.  As between you and GumGum, GumGum is the exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including all intellectual property and proprietary rights recognized anywhere in the world at any time.  3.3.	Modifications.  You agree that GumGum may modify the SDK, including the addition or removal of features or functions, at any time without notifying you in advance.  You acknowledge and agree that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK.  Further, you agree that GumGum has no obligation to make available to you any subsequent versions of the SDK and that GumGum may stop providing the SDK (or any features or functions of the SDK) at any time without notifying you in advance.3.4.	App-IDs.  A license under this License Agreement entitles you to distribute a Licensee Application under one specific explicit App-ID that is not a wildcard App-ID (as described in “Technical Q&A QA1713” of the Apple iOS Developer Library, which is currently located at http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1713/_index.html).  If you distribute applications using the SDK in multiple (Enterprise) App Stores or by other means and/or apply different brandings, you must have one license per distribution channel and/or branded application, even if you use the same App-ID. 4.	Other Agreements.4.1.	Requirements. You agree to use the SDK in accordance with the following requirements:i.	Any Derived Work to be sold, distributed, or otherwise provided to end users must first be compiled to statically link the application to the SDK, producing a final Licensee Application, in which the SDK’s binary object code is embedded as an inseparable part of the Licensee Application’s code, and which is in the form of an executable binary file; ii.	The SDK must be provided only as part of a Derived Work incorporated into a Licensee Application accessible by end users on their Apple iOS mobile devices; iii.	You must own a valid license at the time the SDK is included into your development environment, at the time of compilation and at the time of redistribution of the SDK in any Licensee Application; andiv.	In order to use the SDK, you must purchase the required licenses for the "iOS SDK" framework from Apple Inc. separately and at your own expense and responsibility.4.2.	Restrictions.  You agree not to:i.	Reproduce (except as permitted under this License Agreement) or circumvent any copy protection methods that may be included in the SDK to prevent unauthorized copying;ii.	Modify or create a derivative work of any portion of the SDK;iii.	Use the SDK in any manner (including, without limitation, to develop or distribute an application) that is intended to disrupt, interfere with, damage or access without authorization any other computer or telecommunications systems or networks, property or service; iv.	Violate any applicable law, ordinance, rule, regulation or treaty (including, without limitation, the development, distribution or sale of any product, material, information or service that infringes or violates the rights of another person or entity);v.	Rent, sell, sublicense, redistribute, publish or otherwise transfer any portion of the SDK;vi.	Remove, alter or obscure any product identification or proprietary rights notices or legends contained in the SDK; v.	Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, hack or otherwise attempt to discover any software source code, file formats, interoperability interfaces or programming of the SDK or its structure, sequence or organization, except to the limited extent expressly permitted by applicable law in order to achieve interoperability, in which case you must first notify GumGum and request interoperability information regarding the SDK; vi.	Redistribute the SDK in re-linkable “library” form or in any plain redistribution as licensed to you; vii.	Redistribute the SDK source or header files;viii.	Redistribute or disclose to third parties the SDK source code or Documentation; or ix.	Use the name “GumGum” or the names of its contributors without GumGum’s prior written consent.4.3.	Privacy.  You agree to protect the privacy and legal rights of use of the applications you develop using the SDK.  If your application collects information from users (such as login or personal information), you agree to notify them that this information will be made available to your application and you agree to provide a legally adequate privacy notice.  If your application stores personal, financial or other sensitive information provided by users, you agree to incorporate appropriate security technology to safeguard this information.4.4.	Operation of Applications.  You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible, and GumGum has no responsibility or obligation to you or any third party, for the operation of the applications you develop using the SDK and the consequences of the operation of your applications.5.	Termination.   5.1	Term.  This License Agreement will remain in effect indefinitely, unless it terminated as provided in Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 below.   5.2	Termination by GumGum.  GumGum may at any time terminate this License Agreement if:i.	GumGum determines that you are (a) in breach of or otherwise acting inconsistently with this License Agreement, (b) engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities or other conduct that may result in liability to GumGum or (c) misusing the SDK in violation of this License Agreement or in contradiction to directions given by GumGum regarding use of the SDK;ii.	GumGum determines it is required by law to terminate this  License Agreement; oriii.	GumGum decides to stop providing the SDK or critical portions of the SDK in the country where you reside or use the service to obtain the SDK or GumGum determines that it is no longer in GumGum’s business interests to continue providing the SDK or critical portions of the SDK.   5.3	Termination by You.  You may terminate this License Agreement at any time by providing GumGum with written confirmation that you have completed all of the actions described in Section 5.4 below.     5.4	Obligations Upon Termination.
